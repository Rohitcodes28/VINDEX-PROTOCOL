## 🚀 The Problem
Digital fraud is evolving faster than banks can react. 
* **Social Engineering:** Telegram betting and "task" scams.
* **Invisible Phishing:** Sophisticated clones of payment gateways.
* **The Trust Gap:** Once the money is gone (especially via UPI), it's gone forever.

## 💡 The Solution
Guardian Protocol operates as a dual-layer system:
1. **The Open-Source Ledger:** A decentralized, P2P database of verified fraud signatures (VPAs, URLs, Wallets) powered by **OrbitDB**.
2. **The Sentinel AI:** A cross-platform agent (Browser Ext/Android Overlay) that monitors transactions and cross-references them with our global "Blacklist."
3. **The Insurance Layer:** A premium "Safe-Mode" that offers 100% reimbursement for transactions verified by our protocol.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **P2P Networking:** libp2p
- **Database:** OrbitDB (IPFS-based)
- **AI/ML:** Local-first Llama 3 (for transaction intent analysis)
- **Frontend:** React (Extension) / Kotlin (Android Overlay)
